## Overview

This project aims to provide a user-friendly interface for creating pixel art, with features such as undo/redo functionality, color selection, and pixel manipulation. The application has been refactored to improve modularity and maintainability by introducing several manager classes:

- **CanvasManager**: Manages the canvas element and its properties.
- **DrawingManager**: Handles drawing operations and pixel manipulations.
- **EventManager**: Manages user interactions and events for the pixel editor.
- **ToolManager**: Oversees tool functionalities and interactions.

The `HistorySystem` module is implemented to manage the undo and redo actions.

## Current Status  
- âœ… Robust undo/redo system 
- ðŸš§ Core drawing tools implemented *(in progress)*
    - finished: pencil, eraser, line, bucket
    - in progress: color picker, area selection, magic wand
- ðŸš§ Layers *(in progress)*  

## Planned Features 
- Export to GIF
- Editiable color palletes
- Responsive design

## Recent Improvements

### Performance Optimizations (v0.5)
- ðŸš€ Undo/redo system now handles 1000-step actions 5x faster (384ms â†’ 65ms)
- ðŸ§¹ Reduced memory usage by 30% in history operations

### Core Enhancements
- Refactored to modular architecture (CanvasManager, ToolManager, etc.)
- Implemented robust history system with merge optimization
