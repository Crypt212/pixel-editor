This project aims to provide a user-friendly interface for creating pixel art, with features such as undo/redo functionality, color selection, pixel manipulation and basic tools (pencil, eraser, line, bucket). The application has been refactored to improve modularity, maintainability and scalability by introducing:

### Managers
- **ToolManager**: Oversees tool functionalities and interactions.
- **LayerManager**: Manages layers and their properties (Will be supported for UI soon).

### Generic Systems
- **HistorySystem**: Manages records in history buffer for undo/redo operations.
- **ChangeSystem**: Manages and records changes done to a collection of data, storing it before and after states.

### General Services
- **Color**: Manages and caches all used colors in application, and provide color manipulation utilities.
- **EventEmitter**: Manages interactions between UI components and the application core logic.
- **PixelChange**: Specification of ChangeSystem class for pixel manipulation.

### Tools
- **ToolService**: Manages services for tools. Composing various tools from collections of services allowing scalability.
- **ServiceConfig**: Manages configuration of tool services.

### UI Components
- Allowiing interactions with the core logic.


## Current Status  
- âœ… Robust undo/redo system 
- âœ… scalable tool interfaces and services
- âœ… basic tools: pencil, eraser, line, bucket
- âœ… random
- ðŸš§ Layers *(in progress)*  

## Planned Features 
- color picker, area selection, magic wand
- Export to GIF
- Editiable color palletes
- Responsive design

## Recent Improvements

### Performance Optimizations (v0.5)
- Undo/redo system now handles 1000-step actions 5x faster (384ms â†’ 65ms)
- Caching pixel changes and used colors, reducing memory usage by 30%
- Reduced memory usage by 30% in history operations
